# tap-urban-airship

This is a [Singer](https://singer.io) tap that produces JSON-formatted data following the [Singer spec](https://github.com/singer-io/getting-started/blob/master/SPEC.md).

This tap:
- Pulls raw data from Urban Airship's [REST API](https://docs.urbanairship.com/api/ua/)
- Extracts the following resources from Urban Airship:
  - [Channels](http://docs.urbanairship.com/api/ua/#api-channels)
  - [Lists](http://docs.urbanairship.com/api/ua/#api-static-lists)
  - [Named Users](http://docs.urbanairship.com/api/ua/#api-named-users)
  - [Segments](http://docs.urbanairship.com/api/ua/#segments-api)
- Outputs the schema for each resource
- Incrementally pulls data based on the input state


## Quick start

1. Install

    ```bash
    > pip install tap-urban-airship
    ```

2. Get your Urban Airship keys

    Sign into your Urban Airship account. In the dashboard, open the app you want to connect to Stitch. If the Engage tab doesnâ€™t open, click Engage at the top to open it. Click the gear icon located near Reports, then select APIs & Integrations.  The APIs & Integrations page will display. Use your Urban Airship App Key and App Secret in the following step.



3. Create the config file

    Create a JSON file called `config.json` containing the key and secret you just found.

    ```json
    {"app_key": "your-app-key",
     "app_secret": "your-app-secret"}
    ```

4. [Optional] Create the initial state file

    You can provide JSON file that contains a date for the API endpoints
    to force the application to only fetch data newer than those dates.
    If you omit the file it will fetch all Urban Airship data

    ```json
    {"channels": "2017-01-17T20:32:05Z",
    "lists": "2017-01-17T20:32:05Z",
    "segments": "2017-01-17T20:32:05Z",
    "named_users": "2017-01-17T20:32:05Z"}
    ```

5. Run the application

    `tap-urban-airship` can be run with:

    ```bash
    tap-urban-airship --config config.json [--state state.json]
    ```
